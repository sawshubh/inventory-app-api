# Inventory Management System API

The **Inventory Management System API** is a backend service built using **Django Rest Framework** that allows users to manage inventory items. It supports full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing inventory, with secure **JWT-based authentication** for API access. The system is integrated with **PostgreSQL** for robust database management and utilizes **Redis caching** to optimize performance by caching frequently accessed data. Comprehensive **logging** is implemented to track API usage, errors, and debugging.

## Key Features
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access to the API endpoints.
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage inventory items with RESTful API endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable database management system for storing data.
- **Redis Caching**: Improves performance by caching frequently accessed items.
